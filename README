The strategy I used for the clever player is the player will
move on the board col by col from the coordinate (0,0) and put mark in the empty cell
so he will fill cols and will make the other player a difficulty to win.

The strategy I chose for the genius player is to roll on the board from coordinate
(1,0) and put mark in the empty cell each turn so the genius player will be blocking the
other player (the streak of the other player in the col will be destroyed) and fill a row faster
than the clever player and cause him much difficulty to win.

The strategy i chose for the whatever player is choosing a random coordinate
and mark the cell, without any smart thinking

The advantage for using an interface Player for the players is that all of the players
sharing the same function; playTurn, all of them have their turn in the game
but different strategy. Instead implement the same method with different strategy
for each player, I implement an interface and each player is implements by his strategy
I based.


Abstraction:
Designing the system so that you can easily add new players without messing up the existing code.
Information Hiding:
Keeping the details of how each player works a secret, so you can change how they work without
breaking everything else.
Polymorphism:
Using different players with their unique strategies in the same game without causing chaos.
It makes the code flexible and easy to take care of.
